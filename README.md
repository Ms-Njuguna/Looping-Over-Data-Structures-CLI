# Looping-Over-Data-Structures-CLI

This project contains challenges for learning python that include looping over data structures.

## Challenge 1

Loop the Countdown 
- Write a script that:

   1. Takes a number n
   2. Counts down to 0 using a while loop
   3. Prints:

       ```python
        5
        4
        3
        2
        1
        Blast off! 
       ```

---

## Challenge 2

- Ask the user for a number n, then:

   1. Use a for loop and range() to sum from 1 to n
   2. Print the total at the end

- E.g.

```python
Enter a number: 5
The total sum is 15
```

## Challenge 3

- Password Validator (3 tries max)

```python
Enter password:
→ wrong
→ wrong
→ correct → “Access granted!”
→ after 3 wrongs → “Too many attempts. Access denied.”
```

- Use a while loop, input(), and a counter.

---

## Challenge 4

- Write a Python script where:

  1. A secret number (e.g., 7) is stored
  2. User has max 3 tries to guess
  3. If correct → “You got it!”
  4. If not → “Try again”
  5. After 3 fails → “Game over!”

- Extra points:

  1. Print attempt count
  2. Allow user to restart the game after (optional)

---

## Challenge 5

- Loop Else Drill
- Write a loop that:

  1. Loops over a list of numbers
  2. Breaks if it finds a negative number
  3. Else, if loop finishes → print “All numbers are positive”
